## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED NOW**

1. **Deployment Platform:** Railway vs. Vercel+PlanetScale vs. Self-hosted?
2. **Domain Name:** What will be the production URL?
3. **Email Service:** SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES?
4. **Error Monitoring:** Sentry, LogRocket, or basic logging?
5. **Launch Timeline:** Can we commit to 4-6 weeks to launch?

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTION**

**Start immediately with:**
1. **Set up production database** (1 day)
2. **Create basic carer dashboard** (2-3 days)
3. **Deploy to staging environment** (1 day)

This gets you 80% of the way to a launchable product with just the existing codebase plus a minimal carer interface.

**The key insight:** Your admin interface is already production-ready. The missing piece is just giving carers a way to interact with the system. Everything else can be enhanced post-launch.
