## **For Care Workers: Your Personal Dashboard**

### **üè† Daily Dashboard**
When carers log in, they see their personalized dashboard showing:
- **Today's Tasks**: What they can work on today
- **Progress Summary**: How close they are to completing their competency requirements
- **Notifications**: Important updates about ratings, shift assignments, or system changes
- **Quick Stats**: Overall progress percentage and upcoming scheduled shifts
- **Recent Activity**: What they've accomplished lately and any pending confirmations

---

### **‚úÖ Daily Task Assessment**
*Recording daily work activities*

**Purpose**: Track completion of care tasks to build competency ratings over time.

**How It Works:**
1. **Daily Questions**: The system asks "Today, have you performed [TASK NAME]?"
2. **Simple Logging**: If yes, enter how many times (e.g., "administered medication 5 times")
3. **Global Tracking**: All completions count toward your overall progress, regardless of which care location you're working at
4. **Real-Time Progress**: See your completion percentage update immediately
5. **Task Completion**: Once you reach 100% of the target completions, the task disappears from daily assessment

**Real Example:**
Sarah needs to complete 50 medication administrations to be considered competent. She's currently at 47/50. Today she helps with medication 3 times. Her progress updates to 50/50 (100%), and she's now ready for competency assessment.

**Smart Features:**
- Tasks only appear if you're under 100% completion
- If all tasks are complete, you see "All tasks completed! (100.0%)"
- Can log 1-100 completions per day with validation
- Progress tracked across all care packages you work at

---

### **üìà Progress Tracking**
*Monitoring your professional development*

**What You See:**
- **Visual Progress Bars**: Clear percentage completion for each assigned task
- **Competency Status**: Your current rating for each task:
  - Not Assessed (starting point)
  - Non Competent (needs more training)
  - Advanced Beginner (developing skills)
  - Competent (qualified for independent work)
  - Proficient (skilled and experienced)
  - Expert (advanced practitioner)
- **Achievements**: Milestones and completed competencies
- **Pending Confirmations**: Any competency changes waiting for your acknowledgment

**Competency Confirmation Process:**
1. **Assessment Completion**: Manager completes your competency assessment
2. **Email Notification**: You receive an email about the rating change
3. **Legal Confirmation**: You must log in and confirm you acknowledge the new rating
4. **Rating Activation**: Only after confirmation does the new rating take effect
5. **Shift Eligibility**: Your confirmed competencies determine which shifts you can take

**Global Competency System:**
- Once competent in a task, you're competent everywhere
- If you work at multiple locations, your competency applies to all
- New location assignments automatically inherit your existing competencies
- Progress builds up across all care packages you're assigned to

---

### **üïê Shift Management**
*Viewing and applying for work opportunities*

**Available Shifts Display:**
- **Filtered by Competency**: Only see shifts you're actually qualified for
- **Shift Details**: Date, time, care location, specific requirements

---

### **üèòÔ∏è Card 2: Care Packages**
*Managing care locations and clients*

**Purpose**: Define and organize the different locations where care is provided.

**Information Stored:**
- **Care Package Name**: "Sunny Manor Care Home", "Green Valley Residential"
- **Postcode Area**: First 3 digits only (e.g., "M14") for privacy compliance
- **Assignment Summary**: Which carers work at each location

**Use Cases:**
- Multiple care homes under one management company
- Different departments within a large facility
- Community care packages for different geographic areas
- Specialized care units (dementia, rehabilitation, etc.)

**Real Example:**
You manage three facilities: "Sunny Manor Care Home" (M14), "Green Valley Residential" (M15), and "Riverside Community Care" (M16). Each is set up as a separate care package, allowing you to assign different carers and requirements to each location.

---

### **‚úÖ Card 3: Tasks Management**
*Defining work activities and competency requirements*

**Purpose**: Create and manage the specific care tasks that staff need to learn and perform.

**Task Configuration:**
- **Task Name**: "Medication Administration", "Personal Care Assistance", "Mobility Support"
- **Target Count**: How many completions equal 100% progress (e.g., 50 medication administrations)
- **Assessment Link**: Which competency assessment covers this task

**Examples of Tasks:**
- **Medication Administration** (Target: 50) - Giving medications safely and accurately
- **Personal Care Assistance** (Target: 30) - Helping with washing, dressing, toileting
- **Mobility Support** (Target: 25) - Assisting with movement and transfers
- **Meal Preparation** (Target: 40) - Preparing and serving meals
- **Emergency Response** (Target: 10) - Handling medical emergencies

**Target Count Logic:**
The target represents how many times a carer needs to successfully perform the task before they're ready for competency assessment. Higher numbers for complex or critical tasks, lower numbers for simpler activities.

---

### **üîó Card 4: Assignments**
*Connecting carers to locations and tasks*

**Two Types of Assignments:**

**Carer-to-Package Assignments:**
- **Purpose**: Determine which carers work at which care locations
- **Effect**: Carer automatically gets all tasks assigned to that package
- **Global Progress**: Existing task progress carries over to new locations
- **Competency Inheritance**: Existing competencies automatically apply

**Task-to-Package Assignments:**
- **Purpose**: Define which tasks are performed at each care location
- **Effect**: All carers assigned to that package inherit those tasks
- **Flexibility**: Different locations can have different task requirements

**Real-World Example:**
Sarah currently works at Sunny Manor and has completed 30/50 medication administrations. You assign her to also work at Green Valley, which also requires medication administration. Her 30 completions automatically count toward Green Valley's requirements too, and any existing competency in medication admin applies at both locations.

**Smart Assignment Features:**
- **Automatic Inheritance**: New assignments pick up existing progress and competencies
- **Global Tracking**: Progress counts across all assigned locations
- **Flexible Staffing**: Easily move carers between locations as needed
- **No Lost Progress**: Previous work always counts toward new assignments

---

### **üìã Card 5: Assessments**
*Creating competency evaluation templates*

**Purpose**: Design structured assessments to evaluate carer competency in different areas of care.

**4-Section Assessment Structure:**

**1. Knowledge Section:**
- **Question Field**: Theoretical knowledge to test
- **Model Answer**: Guide for assessors on expected responses
- **Purpose**: Ensure carers understand the principles behind their work

**2. Practical Skills Section:**
- **Skill Description**: Hands-on demonstration required
- **Not Applicable Option**: For when practical assessment isn't possible
- **Purpose**: Verify carers can perform tasks correctly in practice

**3. Emergency Section:**
- **Emergency Scenario**: Crisis situation to evaluate
- **Model Answer**: Appropriate response guidelines
- **Purpose**: Ensure carers can handle urgent situations safely

**4. Tasks Section:**
- **Task Selection**: Choose which work tasks this assessment covers
- **Grouping Logic**: Tasks covered by the same assessment are grouped together
- **Trigger Rule**: Assessment becomes available when ALL grouped tasks reach 100% progress

**Assessment Example - Medication Administration:**
- **Knowledge**: "Explain the 5 Rights of medication administration"
- **Practical**: "Demonstrate proper medication preparation and administration"
- **Emergency**: "A resident refuses their medication. What do you do?"
- **Tasks Covered**: Medication Administration, Medication Recording, Side Effect Monitoring

**Key Rule**: Each task can only belong to ONE assessment. This ensures clear competency pathways and prevents confusion about when assessments are triggered.

2. **Assessment Process**: Admin works through all 4 sections
3. **Knowledge Evaluation**: Review carer's answers to knowledge questions
4. **Practical Assessment**: Rate hands-on demonstration
5. **Emergency Response**: Evaluate crisis management capability
6. **Final Rating**: Admin uses professional judgment to assign overall competency level
7. **Documentation**: All answers and ratings saved for compliance

**Page 3: Manual Management**
- **Direct Rating Changes**: Admins can manually adjust competency levels
- **Special Reset Rule**: Setting to "Not Assessed" also resets task progress to zero
- **Audit Logging**: All manual changes tracked for compliance
- **Emergency Overrides**: Ability to fast-track competencies when needed

**Page 4: Confirmation Management**
- **Pending Confirmations**: Track competency changes awaiting carer acknowledgment
- **Legal Requirement**: New ratings don't take effect until carer confirms
- **Notification System**: Automated reminders after 48 hours
- **Confirmation Tracking**: Monitor which carers need to confirm changes

**Important Rule**: Only NEW competency assessments require confirmation. If a carer moves to a new location and already has a competency, it automatically applies (pre-confirmed) since they've already acknowledged that rating previously.
